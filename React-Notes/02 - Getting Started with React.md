### Current understanding of React:

- React has things called components.
- A single component can have many more components.
- React will manage the real DOM efficiently as you continue to make changes to the Virtual DOM. (This is done by the library 'react-dom')

##### I learnt how to set up a brand new React project using a tool called #vite. We also touched upon how to create a new component and the files structure of a React app. Mosh also explained how and where React renders the components that we create.
